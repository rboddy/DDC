This basic Diabetes Dosage calculator will serve as a place for to practice some of the basics I've picked up while learning C++ 
using a topic that I know about. It also serves as a way for me to use GitHub, which is definitely a service I wish I had heard
about earlier.

I began as a Java programmer and spent a lot of time with that language so the transition to C++ has been relatively simple 
and I'm really enjoying it.

I was originally pushing commits directly through xcode, but then noticed that that doesn't update my github users commits so I'll just push directly through the site.
